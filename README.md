# DX11 Renderer

This project is a **custom renderer** built from scratch using **DirectX 11**, showcasing core principles of real-time graphics programming. It emphasizes **modularity**, **scalability**, and **performance**, featuring advanced rendering techniques like dynamic lighting, PBR, and custom shaders.

---

## Features
- **Custom Rendering Pipeline**: Handles vertex processing, rasterization, and fragment shading for real-time performance.
- **Shader Implementation**: Hand-written HLSL shaders for dynamic lighting, shadowing, and PBR.
- **Advanced Lighting**: Supports point, directional, and spotlights with shadow mapping.
- **Material System**: Flexible material and texture system with support for normal maps, specular maps, and dynamic texture loading.
- **Bindable Drawable Design**: Decouples resource management and rendering logic for modularity and scalability.
